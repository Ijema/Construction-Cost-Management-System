      <p class="tribute-info">You can imagine the joy i always feel within visiting grannyâ€™s place every holclassay. You were so lovely, prayerful, kind and the best granny anyone could ask for.

        <p class="tribute-info">I will try not to be sad because I know you are resting in a better place. I will miss your love, advice, kind gesture and smile and tender love. I will never forget you, you will always have a special place in my heart. Sleep on grandma.</p>

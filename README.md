The system is designed to help construction companies manage their project costs more efficiently by providing real-time tracking and analysis of expenses. The report discusses the system's features, design, and implementation, as well as its potential benefits for construction companies.

**Introduction**
Construction companies face numerous challenges in managing their project costs, such as unexpected expenses, change orders, and budget overruns. To address these challenges, a construction cost management system was developed to enable real-time tracking and analysis of expenses. The system's design is based on PHP and MySQL, which are widely used for developing web-based applications.

**Features**
The construction cost management system include the following features:
1.	Project Management: The system enable construction companies to manage their projects, including project timelines, budgets, and milestones.
2.	Cost Tracking: The system track project expenses in real-time, including labor, materials, equipment, and subcontractor costs.
3.	Budgeting: The system enable construction companies to create project budgets and track actual expenses against those budgets.
4.	Reporting: The system will provide various reports, including project costs, budget vs. actuals, and variance analysis.

**Design**
The construction cost management system is designed as a web-based application using PHP, XAMPP, and MySQL. The system have a user-friendly interface that enable construction companies to easily input data and generate reports. The system consist of the following modules:

1)	The Login Form Module
The form serves as a means for users to authenticate themselves and gain access to the new system.

2)	The Estimation Form Module
This enables the project manager to forecast the project's cost and whether the client will indeed be able to complete the work. The project manager fills in the projected material, labour, and equipment requirements and receives a final estimate.

3)	The Project Form Module
A new project can be registered in the project form module by entering the project name, kind of building, start and end dates, project manager(s) and team member(s) allocated project estimate, and thorough description of the project.
This module also gives a way to see which past projects are available.

4)	The View Project Form Module
In this module, past and present project details are displayed. Here all the details of the project are displayed.

5)	The Edit Project Module
This module permits modifications to be made to desired projects.

6)	 The Task Form Module
After the team member or manager has gone over the project in detail, they can update it with the tasks that have been performed and what still needs to be done. The task form module then displays the various tasks that have been completed by members of a project's team, as well as those that have been assigned by the manager.

7)	 The User Form Module
In the User form module, new employees are registered with their first and last name, email address, and password for login details, avatar, and role in the team.
This module also allows you to examine and change old employee records.

8)	The View User Form Module
In the view User Form module, details of users are displayed in this form.

9)	The Report Form Module
The project summary can be printed using the report form module.

**Implementation**
The following steps is taken to implement the system:
1. Download and install XAMPP: First, download and install XAMPP on your computer. XAMPP is an open-source software that allows you to run a local server on your computer.
2.	Install a database management system: Once you have installed XAMPP, you need to install a database management system like MySQL. This will allow you to store and manage your construction cost data.
3.	Create a database: After installing a database management system, create a new database for your construction cost management system. You can do this by opening phpMyAdmin from the XAMPP control panel, selecting the "Databases" tab, and entering a name for your database (tms_db).
4.	Import the database: Import the SQL file that comes with the downloaded source code into your database using phpMyAdmin.
5.	Copy the source code: Copy the downloaded source code into the htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation. This is where the local server will serve the web pages from.
6.	Configure the database connection: Open the source code files and look for the database connection code. Update the code with the name of your database, username, and password.
7.	Start the XAMPP server: Start the XAMPP server from the XAMPP control panel.
8.	Open the web application: Open a web browser and type "localhost/construction_cost_management_system/" in the address bar. This should open the construction cost management system in your browser.
9.	Test the system: Test the system to ensure that everything is working properly. Create a new project, add costs and expenses, and generate reports.

**Conclusion**
The construction cost management system developed using PHP, XAMPP, and MySQL enables construction companies to manage their project
